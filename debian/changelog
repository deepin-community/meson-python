meson-python (0.15.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Confirmed to build successfully with python3.12 (Closes: #1055576)
  * Update build-dependencies
    - Depend on meson (>= 1.2.3) for Python 3.12 compatibility
    - Depend on python3-all-venv.
      Thanks to Graham Inggs / Ubuntu.
    - Drop setuptools, no longer needed
    - Reduce Sphinx build-dependencies.
      Several of these are no longer needed.
  * Update patch series
    - d/p/docs-Remove-external-image-references.patch:
      No longer needed since 491749c2 upstream
    - d/p/docs-Disable-sphinx_contributors-plugin.patch:
      No longer needed since 6540f7c7 upstream
    - d/p/tests-Skip-test_consistency-during-Debian-build.patch:
      No longer needed
    - d/p/ignore-failing-tests-for-the-moment.patch:
      One of the failing tests was dropped in a0f0827d upstream,
      another is no longer failing.
  * d/rules: Stop working around zeroed mtime in the source tarball.
    Newer upstream releases no longer have that.

meson-python (0.13.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * d/copyright: Update for new upstream release
  * d/control: Update (build-)dependencies for new upstream release
  * d/rules: Don't copy an upstream signature from debian/upstream/ into
    the parent directory during build.
    There's no obvious source for an upstream signature for 0.13.2, and if
    one is available, we should teach debian/watch to download it instead.
  * d/patches: Refresh patch series
  * d/p/ignore-failing-tests-for-the-moment.patch:
    Stop marking test_scipy_like as expected to fail: it now passes
  * d/p/docs-Disable-sphinx_contributors-plugin.patch:
    Add patch to disable an unpackaged sphinx plugin
  * d/p/tests-Skip-test_consistency-during-Debian-build.patch:
    Skip a test that makes assumptions about the source/build tree layout.
    This is a consistency check for the upstream maintainers rather than
    a functional test that is necessary in Debian.
  * d/p/Exclude-ninja-from-dependencies.patch:
    Remove patch, no longer applied or needed since 0.12.0
  * d/python3-mesonpy.docs: Adjust for reformatting of README.rst
